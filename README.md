# DearInventory

A Ruby API client for connecting to DEAR Inventory. At this point, I have only been implementing the GET requests based upon our business needs but, if you like the look of this gem but require a missing endpoint, it would be quite easy to bolt on POST/PUT/Delete endpoints.

Honestly, the DEAR API is a mess. Where possible, this gem attempts to hide the rampant inconsistencies and provide continuity but I'm afraid I'm no magician.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "dear_inventory"
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install dear_inventory

## Configuration

Before you begin, you will need to setup API credentials in DEAR Inventory at https://inventory.dearsystems.com/ExternalApi

Next you need to supply your API credentials:

```ruby
require "dear_inventory"

DearInventory.configure do |config|
  config.account_id = "account_id"
  config.key = "key"
end
```

There is a default logger set to write to STDOUT which is also configurable

```ruby
DearInventory.configure do |config|
  ...
  config.logger = CustomLogger.new
end
```

## Endpoints

- [Customer](https://github.com/HashNotAdam/dear_inventory-ruby/blob/master/docs/resources/customer.md)
- [Product](https://github.com/HashNotAdam/dear_inventory-ruby/blob/master/docs/resources/product.md)
- [Product Availability](https://github.com/HashNotAdam/dear_inventory-ruby/blob/master/docs/resources/product_availability.md)
- [Purchase](https://github.com/HashNotAdam/dear_inventory-ruby/blob/master/docs/resources/purchase.md)
- [Advanced Purchase](https://github.com/HashNotAdam/dear_inventory-ruby/blob/master/docs/resources/advanced_purchase.md)
- [Sale](https://github.com/HashNotAdam/dear_inventory-ruby/blob/master/docs/resources/sale.md)

## Managing pagination

The response object for any endpoint that returns a paginated result set will include helper methods for retrieving the results.

### each

`each` iterates over all the records as if they were not paginated, automatically retrieving subsequent pages.

```ruby
DearInventory::Customer.().each do |record|
	do_some_things(record)
end
```

### next_page

If you would like control over the pagination process, the paginated responses include a `next_page` method

```ruby
response = DearInventory::Customer.()

loop do
  do_some_things(response)
  break unless response.next_page?
  response = response.next_page
end
```

## Exceptions

Exceptions that occur while making a request to DEAR Inventory should be a subclass of DearInventory::RequestError. These errors include the DearInventory::Response instance which provides some flexibility in your error reporting.

```ruby
def find_a_sale
  DearInventory::Sale.(id: "incorrect")
rescue DearInventory::RequestError => e
  message = [
    e.message,
    "URI: #{e.response.request.uri}",
    "Params: #{e.response.request.params.to_h}"
  ]
  ErrorMonitoring.error(message.join("\n"))
end
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).

Since it is necessary to authenticate with DEAR Inventory to test API resources, credentials are required. The dotenv gem is loaded when tests are run and will look for a .env file in the root directory. A .env.example file has been supplied so you copy it to .env and replace the example values:

```sh
cp .env.example .env
```
