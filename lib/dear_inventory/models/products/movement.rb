# This model has been designed to match the Dear API documentation, however,
# some of the field types don't make sense. Unfortunately, when trying to check
# what is being sent by the API, it turns out Dear is responding with an empty
# array even in situations where a movement exists for a product. The model will
# remain here incase the API is ever fixed but it will need to be reviewed in
# that case
